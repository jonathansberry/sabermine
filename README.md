# Sabermine Technical Exercise

There's a sort of POC "Url Shortener" solution working now, but there are many ways it should be improved. I have deployed the backend successfully to AWS with CDK.  The endpoint I have deployed is [here](https://5bqey8zso9.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod/api).  I've just been using the Next.js dev server for local frontend development.

Project plan for further work is available as a [Google Sheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mo8X4ptyp5DgHrW5BdqrpXL7aK0oKaokBlD0RlRAkNc/edit?gid=0#gid=0).  Would usually prefer to use a Kanban board tool such as Github Projects, but since it sounded like you wanted an actual document or file, so I've gone with Google sheets.
